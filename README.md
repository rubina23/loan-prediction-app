# Loan Prediction App

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts loan approval status based on applicant information.  
This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, saving, and deployment.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing the dataset
2. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression chosen as the primary model
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – GridSearchCV used for optimization
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
5. **Model Saving** – Saved using `pickle` for reproducibility
6. **Deployment** – Gradio app deployed on Hugging Face Spaces

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** 100%
- **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-score reported for each class
- **Confusion Matrix:** Shows correct vs incorrect predictions

- The model achieved perfect classification on the test set, with precision, recall, and F1-score all equal to 1.00. The confusion matrix shows zero misclassifications.
